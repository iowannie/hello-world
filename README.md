Learning how......
Am I editing the readme or the master?
Got it. readme gets edited; master houses everything and is not editable.  Duh.
Nope. The master seems to be getting edited, not the readme.  Blame it on the thunderstorm.
I see no "Finish readme" as in the example, so one of these things is not like the other.
